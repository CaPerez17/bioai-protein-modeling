## 📋 About

This repository contains my journey learning **protein modeling** and **BioAI**, with the goal of becoming a strong candidate for companies like EvolutionaryScale. The project focuses on:

- **FASTA sequence analysis** - Reading and processing protein sequences
- **Protein mutations** - Generating and analyzing point mutations
- **ESM embeddings** - Using Meta's Evolutionary Scale Modeling for protein representations
- **RESTful API** - Building a FastAPI service for protein analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Biopython** - Biological sequence manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive experimentation
- **FastAPI** - Modern web framework for APIs
- **ESM Models** - Pre-trained protein language models (Meta AI)
